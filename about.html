          <h2 class="mt-5" id="choosingrecipes">How we choose our recipes</h2>
          <p class="mt-4">Our recipes try to keep in mind the busy lives of everyday people, while including healthy and easy to cook meals for everyone. We believe in a healthy, balanced diet that includes <i>everything</i>(Buter, fruits, vegetables, protein...and all the sweets too!)</p>
          <p>There are three things we keep in mind for all our recipes:</p>
          <p><strong>How easy is it to cook?</strong> We want to guarantee that <i>everyone</i>, regardless of culinary abilities, can cook these recipes.</p>
          <p><strong>Is it healthy?</strong> We want to make it easier for busy people to eat nutritious food that will benefit their health.</p>
          <p><strong>Finally, is it tasty?</strong> There is no point to healthy for the sake of healthy, a meal that isn't tasty is pointless to us.</p>
          <p>To make sure each of these standards are met, we work with nutritionists, chefs and customer feedback - every angle is covered to make sure we offer the best service possible. We also have a rigorous process checking every single line of a recipe to make sure it is as efficient and easy as possible.</p>
          <p>Additionally, at EasyCooking, we aspire to provide a human service, which means that we rigorously check submissions for AI and we guarantee that every recipe on this website has be written by a human.</p>
